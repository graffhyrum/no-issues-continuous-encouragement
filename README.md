## No Issues, Continuous Encouragement...

This project is for the testers out there that need a little dopamine hit. It runs a configurable number of
guaranteed-to-pass tests with an adjustable delay in between. It's a fun way to keep your spirits up while you're
waiting for your tests to run.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.29. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
